# EDA - Customer Churn in Telcom
I followed the guide from [A Comprehensive Guide to Data Exploration](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/#one) to perform and discuss completely exploratory data analysis of the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
## Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to see what data can tell us beyond the formal sophisticated analysis and summarize dataset main characteristics with visual methods. To be more specific, we use EDA to gain insight into a dataset, examine variables, detect anomalies, and prepare data before applying a predictive model. Since good input quality will lead to good output quality, this process could also help to increase the accuracy of the models. Thus, it is important to spend significant time on it.
## Steps 
1. Variable Identification 
   - Predictor and Target
   - Data Type
   - Variable Category
2. Univariate Analysis 
   - Numerical
   - Categorical
3. Bi-variate Analysis 
   - Categorical & Categorical
   - Categorical & Numerical
   - Numerical & Numerical
4. Missing Value Treatment 
5. Outlier Treatment 
6. Feature Engineering
   - Variable Transformation
   - Variable/Feature Creation
## Conclusion
To summarize, I have fixed data types, treated missing values, cleaned categories, and built some graphs to gain insights. From the univariate analysis, I revealed the overall condition in the dataset, and from the bi-variate analysis, I got some clues of which variable (tenure, MonthlyCharges, and SeniorCitizen) might have a significant impact on customer churn. After descriptive analysis, next, I can start performing predictive analysis: [Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom](https://github.com/yuki04160/Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Telecom).
